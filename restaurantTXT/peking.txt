If I'm ordering out Chinese I usually go with West Place (or Thai Market for Thai food...MMM!!)  I've lived in the neighborhood for 4+ years and have little experience with the 'faster food' joints along 116 & FDB, but noticed a few weeks ago these guys had an \"A\" rating and you can't help but notice how bright it is in there, which I thought was a plus.   So last night on my way back from Best Yet Market I decided I'd stop in, ask for a menu, and check it out.  They were super friendly.  The menu was standard, and one thing I really liked was that you can watch everything being prepared in their galley kitchen.  I ordered dumplings, fried rice and egg rolls and all of it was very good.  In fact friend rice was quite a bit better than I've had delivered from places up near Columbia.   I think I've found my new place.   And it's so close I can just pick it up myself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O2jCWIOWb-IhyZGZLTNNoA"}
